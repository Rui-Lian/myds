Hereâ€™s a comprehensive tutorial on how to use the **Dataview** plugin in Obsidian, covering installation, basic queries, and practical examples.

## Installing Dataview

1. **Open Obsidian Settings**:
   - Click on the **Settings** icon in the bottom left corner.

2. **Enable Community Plugins**:
   - Navigate to the **Community plugins** tab.
   - Toggle on **Safe mode** if it's currently enabled.
   - Click on **Turn on community plugins**.

3. **Install Dataview**:

   - Click on the Dataview plugin and then hit **install**.
   - After installation, click **enable** to activate the plugin.

4. **Configure Settings**:

## Creating a Dataview Code Block

1. **Open or Create a Note**:
   - Start a new note or open an existing one in your Obsidian vault.

2. **Add a Code Block**:
   - Type three backticks (```) to create a code block.
   - Specify `dataview` for standard queries or `dataviewjs` for JavaScript queries.

3. **Edit the Code Block**:
   - Click on **edit this block** at the top right to enter your query.

## Writing Queries

### Basic Structure
A basic Dataview query follows this structure:

```markdown
```dataview
TABLE file.name AS "File Name"
FROM "FolderName"
WHERE file.name = "Example Note"
SORT file.ctime DESC
```
```

### Key Components

- **Type of Query**: Specify whether you want a `table`, `list`, or `task`.
- **Fields**: Define which fields to display (e.g., `file.ctime` for creation time).
- **Source**: Use `FROM` to specify where to pull data from (a folder or specific notes).
- **Conditions**: Use `WHERE` to filter results based on certain criteria.
- **Sorting**: Use `SORT` to order your results by specific fields.

### Example Queries

1. **List All Notes in a Folder**:
    ```markdown
    ```dataview
    LIST
    FROM "MyFolder"
    ```
    ```

2. **Table of Tasks with Completion Status**:
    ```markdown
    ```dataview
    TABLE file.link AS "Task", status AS "Status"
    FROM "TasksFolder"
    WHERE status = "Incomplete"
    SORT file.cday ASC
    ```
    ```

3. **Querying with Inline Fields**:
   You can also use inline fields within your notes. For example, in a note, you might have:
   ```markdown
   ---
   project: "Project A"
   status: "In Progress"
   ---
   ```
   Then query it like this:
   ```markdown
   ```dataview
   TABLE project, status
   FROM "Projects"
   WHERE status = "In Progress"
   ```
   ```

### Additional Tips

- Use `group by` to categorize results (e.g., group tasks by their completion status).
- Rename columns using `AS` followed by your desired name (e.g., `file.link AS "Link"`).
- To remove default ID columns, use `WITHOUT ID`.

## Practical Use Cases

1. **Creating a Reading List**: 
   You can create a list of books or articles you want to read by tagging them appropriately and querying based on those tags.

2. **Tracking Tasks and Projects**: 
   Use Dataview to pull all tasks from various notes into one comprehensive list, allowing you to manage your workload effectively.

3. **Dynamic Dashboards**: 
   Build dashboards that summarize various aspects of your notes, such as recent changes, upcoming deadlines, or project statuses.

## Conclusion

The Dataview plugin significantly enhances Obsidian's capabilities by allowing users to treat their notes as a database. By following this tutorial, you should be able to install Dataview, write basic queries, and apply them in practical scenarios within your Obsidian vault.
