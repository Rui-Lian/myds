Here are the key `forcats` functions for factor manipulation:

- `fct_rev()` – Reverse the order of factor levels.
- `fct_reorder()` – Reorder factor levels based on another variable.
- `fct_inorder()` – Order factors based on their appearance in the data.
- `fct_infreq()` – Order factors by their frequency.
- `fct_lump()` – Combine infrequent levels into a new category.
- `fct_drop()` – Drop unused levels.
- `fct_explicit_na()` – Explicitly mark NA as a factor level.
- `fct_recode()` – Recode factor levels.
